# Chicago R User Group: Call For Presentations

Informal conversations over the lest few months led to the collective idea that we should open up the group and put out a call for presenters.


Organizer Parfait Gasana started a Google form and invited organizers to **edit** with the following note:

_... Feel free to adjust wording, add/edit questions, headers, adjust theme, image banner, etc. and even the confirmation message: "Thanks for submitting your contact and proposed topic details! We will be in touch should our event planning align. See you at the next meetup!" _ 
_Once final, I wonder if we can regularly send this to new members in Meetup periodically like every 6 months (avoiding existing members who already received it). Let me know your thoughts._
